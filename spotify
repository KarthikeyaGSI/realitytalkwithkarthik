        "description": "A few months ago, I caught myself in a familiar trap. There I was, spending an hour tinkering with an email subject line. I’d analyzed variations, scrutinized analytics from previous newsletters, and obsessed over every word.I finally looked at the clock and laughed.Because I knew the truth — all that “optimizing” probably wouldn't move the needle more than 1%.And I wasn't just wasting time. I was optimizing for the wrong thing entirely.The Optimization TrapWe're told to A/B test everything. Track every metric. Optimize every funnel step. Split test every headline. Hell, I've preached most of this stuff myself at some point or another.“If you're not optimizing, you're leaving money on the table!”But here's something less talked about:You've gotta leave something on the table.And if it's not money, it’ll be your time, your sanity, your relationships, or your health. Something always gets left behind (especially when money is the target).Every hour you spend tweaking your landing page is an hour you're not spending on something else. And every minute spent testing button colors is a minute you're not creating something new.As I reflect on my career as an entrepreneur, I remember this mistake repeated over and over again.A friend of mine spent six months \"optimizing\" his course sales page. And he ended up improving his conversion rate by 2%. That translated to an extra $10,000 during his latest launch, which sounds great.But during those six months, he could have created three new products, written 24 newsletters, launched a coaching program, or done anything else that would have earned him 10x that same revenue. So the opportunity cost was massive.And that’s the same trap I found myself falling into with that subject line.When Good Enough Beats PerfectThinking about this led me to run an experiment during my current sabbatical in France. I decided to spend less time on social media and watch what would happen. Less time commenting, responding, scrolling Twitter, making connections, etc.The result? My revenue dropped about 3%.But I gained back about ten hours a week! And I spent those hours pondering a new business idea, letting my mind wander, and having lunch with my wife in the world’s best food city.It’s been refreshing, to say the least. And I've sorted out a new business idea that might make up for that 3% loss. Plus, I’m feeling better — recharged and excited to work on an exciting new thing.Now don’t get me wrong here. I'm not suggesting you shouldn't optimize anything. And I’m not telling you to drop everything and pretend like nothing matters. Of course that would be silly.But I am suggesting that you focus your energy and optimization efforts on things that really matter:* Your core product that serves your customers* Your main page that drives 80% of your revenue* Your onboarding sequence that sets client expectationsBut most things?You'd be better off getting them to \"good enough\" and launched, than \"perfect\" and in a perpetual holding pattern.The 80/20 Decision FrameworkHere's how I try to decide what deserves my optimization time. And this is a thinking structure you can use too.When you find yourself tinkering endlessly with a small detail:* Consider the real impact of making the improvement. Not the theoretical impact — the actual impact, based on your revenue numbers.* Estimate the real cost — including opportunity cost, mental energy, and time away from other projects (like your friends and family).* Now ask yourself: Does the impact absolutely dwarf the cost?Here are some real-world examples to show you what I mean:Not Worth It: Spending 20 hours to improve an email sequence that makes $1,500/month by 10%. That's a $150 monthly improvement. (Not worth 20 hours of your time)Consider Carefully: Spending 20 hours to improve a coaching program that generates $8,000/month by 15%. That's a $1,200 monthly improvement. (But could that time be used to create something new instead?)Definitely Worth It: Spending 20 hours to improve a landing page that generates $80,000/month by 5%. That's a $4,000 monthly improvement. (Now we're talking.)Of course, these numbers will vary among different people and scenarios. But at least you have a framework here to help you make better decisions.The Freedom of Good EnoughThe beautiful part about embracing \"good enough\" is that your time is freed up to focus on what actually matters:* Building more (or other) things* Taking more creative risks* Opening up more head space for exciting projectsI’m slowly but surely realizing that \"good enough\" usually is good enough.Because at the end of the day, your customers care more about the value you provide than whether your button color is the right shade of blue. (Yes, I’m talking to myself here.)Your Challenge This Week:I want you to look at your current to-do list.Identify one thing you've been trying to make perfect that could be \"good enough\" as it is now, and ship it.Then use your freed-up time to create something new or do something different. For example, taking a walk outside is a helluva lot better than looking at a computer screen for one more minute (and it really gets the creative juices flowing).Because perfect isn't just the enemy of good. It's the enemy of growth.And that’s all for today.Thanks for reading! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. To hear more, visit karthikeyathallapally.substack.com",

        "description": "“Someday” is a dangerous lie.I believed a lie for a long time. And I bet you’ve believed it too.It goes something like this:Just put in the work now, sacrifice everything, and someday it'll all be worth it.A few weeks ago, I had coffee with a friend who's crushing it by every business metric. His SaaS business crossed $5M ARR with ten employees, he’s been featured in Fast Company, and his board is thrilled. An entrepreneur’s dream, right?But midway through our conversation, sharing the less-sexy details of his story, this guy got physically upset in a crowded coffee shop.\"I've been saying 'someday' for seven years,” he told me. “Someday I'll take that trip with my wife. Someday I'll be at my kid's events. Someday I'll get back in shape.\"But it turns out his somedays are taking too long. And life outside of work is at a breaking point.His marriage is not going well. He’s out of touch with his kids. And his doctor just prescribed blood pressure medication.Meanwhile, business is booming.Just put in the work now, sacrifice everything, and someday it'll all be worth it.The Cruel Math of Deferred LivingThe \"someday\" mindset is a scam.Because when we say \"someday,\" we really mean we’re trading guaranteed time today for imaginary time in the future.But the time you could spend talking to your kids tonight is real. Not walking your dog is real, poor little guy. Those trips you're skipping are real. The conversations you're not having with your partner at dinner are very real. And adding up.We can’t get those opportunities back later.And the perpetual habit of trading now for later adds up to the person you are. Today. Because today is your life. It’s all we can be sure of, here and now.And despite wishful thinking, you won’t change who you’ve become by achieving a milestone “someday.” People don’t cross net worth goals and stop looking at their phones obsessively. They don’t see certain numbers and suddenly start connecting with their neglected spouses. And the kids don’t just say, “Hey Dad, we’re so glad you’re back.”That’s not how life works.The free time you expect “someday” doesn't exist now, and evidence suggests it probably never will. Because people hit their \"someday\" numbers and roll straight into new goals.The goalposts keep sprinting away, and life goes on as usual.A Closer Look At “Success”We look at people who've \"made it\" and conveniently ignore how miserable many of them are. Smiling faces painted on.I know seven-figure business owners who:* Can't sleep without medication* Miss their kids' events on the regular* Haven't taken an unplugged vacation in years* Haven't had a real conversation with their spouses in monthsMeanwhile, their social media feeds are full of humblebrags and poetic advice.And that's the whole con. We believe success leads to happiness. But in reality, the path to success often destroys the things that actually create happiness.I Tried It Both WaysFor the first several years of my business, I lived on the someday plan.I worked long days, ignored my wife more than I’d like to admit, let friendships fade, and told myself it would all be worth it...someday.Then I hit my first “someday” revenue goal. And absolutely nothing changed. I just found new reasons to keep sacrificing. But in the last couple of years, I've committed to doing things differently.I’m very cautious about commitments. I want as few as possible. I limit my work hours. I take long walks without my phone. I take Fridays off, minus one hour. I have dinner with my wife every night, no phones at the table. I’m more social than ever. I’m reading non-business books. I’m taking actual vacations.And the outcome is that I feel more creative and have more enthusiasm for my work. I feel like I’m actually experiencing life instead of just working through it.Breaking the Someday CycleIf this issue is resonating because you're living the \"someday\" life, here are a few tips that might help:* Start by defining your enough: Figure out the actual amount of money that supports your ideal lifestyle. Not society's number. Your number, where you can rest easy and live life.* Schedule your life first, then work: Plan your vacations, date nights, and personal time before you decide to cram your calendar with work. Life first, business second. Then stick to the plan.* Create a \"not someday\" list: Write down experiences that you refuse to put off. Then schedule one of them every month, regardless of how busy you think you are.The Bottom LineSomeday is a goalpost that will keep moving as you inch closer. And it’s an excuse for not showing up today. For yourself, and for the people in your life.The only day we're guaranteed is today, and trading too many todays for somedays is a terrible habit.I'm not suggesting being lazy or quitting what you’re working on. And I’m not saying you don’t have to make sacrifices sometimes. There has to be a balance, of course.I'm suggesting you apply your ambition to your whole life, not just your business.Because the notion of “someday” will keep you on the hamster wheel forever. And nothing is more expensive than regret.Today, we get the chance to live our lives. Right now.Will there be trade-offs and hard work involved in building something meaningful? Of course. But those trade-offs should not destroy our lives in the short term.And the life we have today is all we can be sure of.Thanks for reading!

I’m taking actual vacations.</p><p>And the outcome is that I feel more creative and have more enthusiasm for my work. I feel like I’m actually experiencing life instead of just working through it.</p><p>Breaking the Someday Cycle</p><p>If this issue is resonating because you&#39;re living the &#34;someday&#34; life, here are a few tips that might help:</p><p>* Start by defining your enough: Figure out the actual amount of money that supports your ideal lifestyle. Not society&#39;s number. Your number, where you can rest easy and live life.</p><p>* Schedule your life first, then work: Plan your vacations, date nights, and personal time before you decide to cram your calendar with work. Life first, business second. Then stick to the plan.</p><p>* Create a &#34;not someday&#34; list: Write down experiences that you refuse to put off. Then schedule one of them every month, regardless of how busy you think you are.</p><p>The Bottom Line</p><p>Someday is a goalpost that will keep moving as you inch closer. And it’s an excuse for not showing up today. For yourself, and for the people in your life.</p><p>The only day we&#39;re guaranteed is today, and trading too many todays for somedays is a terrible habit.</p><p>I&#39;m not suggesting being lazy or quitting what you’re working on. And I’m not saying you don’t have to make sacrifices sometimes. There has to be a balance, of course.</p><p>I&#39;m suggesting you apply your ambition to your whole life, not just your business.</p><p>Because the notion of “someday” will keep you on the hamster wheel forever. And nothing is more expensive than regret.</p><p>Today, we get the chance to live our lives. Right now.</p><p>Will there be trade-offs and hard work involved in building something meaningful? Of course. But those trade-offs should not destroy our lives in the short term.</p><p>And the life we have today is all we can be sure of.</p><p></p><p>Thanks for reading!
